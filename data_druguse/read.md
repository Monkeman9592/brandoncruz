This data set shows the use of drugs from the ages of 12 to 65+ and how frequently these participants use them within a year. We can see a range of drugs as listed above. with this we can see how often people are using these drugs, and around what age they started. This data can show us how some drugs may be more popular with the youth, early adults, and the elderly. We can break this down further and see how one drug could be pushed more to a certain age group. 



my intrest in this CSV analysis is over the constant"war on drugs" campaign that started during Nixon.  With this data we can see what age drugs use in our youth is as well as categorize when they first get involved with as well as what they might progress to or when they might not feel an urge not to do any at all. Drug use is not just a youth problem today one of the biggest killers in the span of drugs is oxycodone and its addictive effects that do not only affect our youth but our elderly our early adults and in some cases even children have been exposed to this very destructive drug. Breaking down these data sets to see when groups are people are offered or prescribed at a certain age might be more addictive or destructive than other age groups.
