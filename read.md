Host Death Time: In seconds. How long the host lasted against the boss.

RAW_MELEE - A build based on dealing normal damage with a melee weapon, be that sword and shield, smashing with a giant hammer, or other means.

RAW_CAST - Casters build to deal damage based on their casting type, such as sorcerers who use standard spells for magic damage and clerics who use lighting for lightning damage.

PROC_MELEE - Melee fighters built specifically to cause a status effect to proc, such as rot, frost, or bleed, dealing massive damage after proc or damage over time.

PROC_CAST - Casters built specifically to cause a status effect to proc, such as rot, frost, or bleed.

HYBRID - A mix of the above with no clear activity pointing to a major focus of any previous build
Level - Level of the host, ranging from integers 120 to 180 for the purposes of this dataset.

Phase - The boss holds two phases, Phase 1 and Phase 2. Whichever phase the boss ended on.

Waterflow_Death - The boss has a special attack with a high kill rate. Boolean value if the host died to this specifically.

Health_Pct - Health remaining on the boss at host death. Note that each successful attack the boss lands adds health to its health bar, so this column is suspectable to questioning.

Location - Where in the arena the host died. The ring is somewhat circular and large, taking around 20 seconds to cross from one side to the other. OUTER dictates near the edge, INNER in between the edge and the middle, and CENTER directly in the middle of the arena.

Phantom_Count - Number of phantoms assisting the player. By default, it will always at least be 1 due to my presence.

Phantom_Build - The build of another assisting phantom, if there is one. Holds the same categories for Host Build.

Phantom_Death - If there is another assisting phantom, a boolean value of if that phantom died before the host.\

I chose this file to be my first start as I have taken a intrest in this game and have wanted to know just how difficult this boss is as i have not gotten quite there yet. I hvave decided why not see what would be one of the easyier routs i can take in order to get pass this bose when i get there. I this making a set of well rounded and well geared players might have abetter chance of showing how i can posibly progres with gear or class of carecter. there are also multiple phases the boss goes though and want to see if i can change weponry or matirals inorder to change my strate or decise if i want to make a serten phase easier.
